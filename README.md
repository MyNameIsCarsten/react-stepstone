- **State Management with Redux**: Utilizes Redux to manage the state of the application, providing a centralized and predictable state container.

- **Styled Components**: Styles are implemented using Styled Components, offering a modular and maintainable approach to styling.

- **TypeScript Integration**: The use of TypeScript adds static typing to the project, enhancing code quality and providing better development tooling support.
